### Live Execution Capability

This system is engineered for **direct, real-time execution in live markets**.  
Once your RPC endpoint and private key are configured, all trades, arbitrage, and MEV strategies are executed and settled on-chain—no simulation, no paper trading.

- **Genuine On-Chain Transactions:** Every trade is signed and submitted to the Polygon/Ethereum network.
- **Live Monitoring:** All execution details, including profit, gas, and risks, are streamed to the dashboard as they happen.
- **Manual & Automated Modes:** You can trigger trades from the UI or run fully automated strategies with AI-powered selection.
- **Audit Trail:** Every action is logged for compliance and post-trade analysis.

**Warning:** Only deploy and execute with real funds after thorough backtesting and review.  
Mainnet trading involves risk—ensure your keys and environment are secure.

## Example Test Script & Usage

### Quick Validation: Test Script

You can validate your backend API and transaction flow with a simple Python script:
```python
import requests

# Test health endpoint
health = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/health').json()
print("Health:", health)

# Test pool listing
pools = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/pools').json()
print("Pools:", pools)

# Example trade execution (fill in params as needed)
trade_params = {
    "dex": "uniswap",
    "token_in": "0x...",
    "token_out": "0x...",
    "amount_in": 1000000,
    "min_amount_out": 990000,
    # Add other required params
}
trade = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/api/trade', json=trade_params).json()
print("Trade Response:", trade)
```
**Expected output:**  
- Health status, pool list, trade response with `tx_hash`.

---

### Example Trade Flow

When you execute a trade via the dashboard (User Actions tab) or API, the backend will:

1. Sign and submit a real on-chain transaction
2. Print the transaction hash in the terminal
3. Return the tx hash and status to the frontend for display

**Terminal Output Example:**
```
[2025-10-13 22:01:45] [INFO] Fetched 37 pools from Polygon
[2025-10-13 22:02:11] [TRADE] TX sent: 0xabc123def456...
[2025-10-13 22:02:27] [CONFIRMED] TX 0xabc123def456... mined in block 53388222
```

**Dashboard Output Example:**
```
Trade Executed!
TX Hash: 0xabc123def456... Status: Confirmed Profit: $14.22
```

---

### Log Parser: Analyze System Logs

For deeper validation, use a Python log parser to extract and summarize execution events:
```python
import re

with open("backend.log") as f:
    for line in f:
        # Parse trade execution logs
        match = re.search(r"TX sent: (0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)", line)
        if match:
            print(f"Trade TX: {match.group(1)}")
        # Parse confirmations
        match = re.search(r"CONFIRMED.*(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)", line)
        if match:
            print(f"Confirmed TX: {match.group(1)}")
        # Parse profit
        match = re.search(r"Profit: \\(\\\\d+\.\\\d+)", line)
        if match:
            print(f"Profit: ${match.group(1)}")
```
**This lets you quickly audit trades, confirmations, and profits from backend logs.**
